# my_extension_editor
# shows how to create an editor panel by simply overriding a function.
# you receive the EditorInterface object, so you can ask for almost anything.
# This works by checking if any scripts inherits from ImGuiEditor on save,
# that means it won't load at start, but only when saved after modifying it.
# If you know a way to make it load automatically, let me know.

extends ImGuiEditor

# it needs to be a tool to work
tool

# this is an ImGui object, so you can do direct calls to imgui
